# Intro

This project looks at the Highways agency dataset, attempting to gain some insight from the data.

My aim is to provide visualisations to explore the dataset initially, these can be found in the analysis folder.
To run them, metaflow is required. To do this, install metaflow using pip

`pip install metaflow`

Then run the Flows as such

`python analysis/heat_map_flow.py run`

This will generate some heatmaps showing traffic patterns for the M1, depending on time of day and which junction on the motorway.
